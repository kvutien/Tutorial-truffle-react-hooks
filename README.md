# Getting Started with Truffle and React

## Introduction

This project is an update to the [Truffle Box "React"](https://www.trufflesuite.com/boxes/react). This Truffle Box illustrates a bare-bones React frontend interfacing to a smart contract. The initial goal of this project was to port the original frontend of ConsenSys into a version that uses React "hooks" instead of using classes, as more and more React frontends use this new paradigm, after React v16 has been issued.

In the process, the following changes were also added:
* add a `try/catch` to protect the error when the user forgets in MetaMask to use the local `develop` network generated by Truffle
* add the information to use `node v12.18.4` instead of the latest `v14`, with which `truffle 15.1` is incompatible and can't deploy its `develop` network
* modify `App.css` for another theme of colors than the original all-white theme.

## Purpose of the demo

The Truffle Box React illustrates a large part of the  Truffle+React development lifecycle. Its purpose is to familiarize the reader with the dApp development cycle, using Truffle and React.
* Truffle is used to deploy a local test blockchain, to compile and deploy smart contracts on this blockchain and to run automated tests.
* React is used to support JavaScript frontend development, with compile and execution for immediate visual feedback.

The setup process described below go through 3 stages. The first 2 are described here mainly for the sake of completude but can usually be skipped if already done in another context.
1. **general purpose setup**: this can be skipped if the reader already installed it for other needs;
2. **development setup**: this setup is specific to blockchain+React development, and may also exist already;
3. **specific setup and run**: this part is specific to the demo.

## What is not in the demo
The deployment in production is not included in this demo:
* Truffle can be used to deploy in production on a public testnet or the mainnet
* The standalone frontend code `build` made by React can be deployed in a public hosting service.
  
This deployment stage of the lifecycle is illustrated in another demo, available at https://github.com/kvutien/ipfs-dapp.git

## Install the demo
We'll use the command line console. The following installation instructions are for Linux or MacOS, that are Unix-based. 

If you run Windows, it is strongly recommended to install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and, inside it, install an Ubuntu virtual machine. See instruction guide for both installations in this 4-minute long [YouTube clip:](https://youtu.be/8mns5yqMfZk).

$ cd truffle-react-hooks/client
```
* install the dependencies
``` shell
$ npm install
    ...
    found 80 vulnerabilities (1 low, 79 moderate)
    run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details
$
```
Disregard the warnings. 

## Run the demo
We assume that you have the local blockchain `truffle develop` running. Else see in the [development setup](./README-2.md#install-truffle).
* Compile and deploy the smart contract on the `truffle develop` local network.
``` shell
$ truffle develop
    ...
truffle(develop)> migrate

* make sure once more that Metamask is using the truffle local `develop` network. Else the transaction will be refused. If this is the case, select the network and refresh the screen to reload the dApp.
* if you have already used MetaMask on the local `develop` blockchain, reset the account imported from this network.
* in another console window, run the demo by typing
``` shell
$ cd client
$ npm start
```
* your browser will open a new tab and display

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

* once you confirm, the last line will show "The stored value is: 5". This proves that your frontend is discussing with the smart contract.
* now, edit `App.js` to change the value in the line as recommended. Save. 
* observe that the web page is refreshed, that MetaMask asks you once more to confirm a transaction, and that after you confirm the new value is displayed.

## Most frequent errors
### 1. `truffle develop` does nothing
When `truffle develop` doesn't display the 10 accounts generated as shown above, this means it could not deploy the local blockchain due to an incompatibility betwseen `truffle 5.1` and the version of `nodeJS` that you're using. Use [nvm](https://tecadmin.net/how-to-install-nvm-on-ubuntu-20-04/) (node version manager) to downgrade to `node 12.18.4`
``` shell
$ nvm use 12.18.4
```
### 2. The last line still shows 'The stored value: not set yet' after MetaMask confirm
You probably redeployed again the `truffle develop` network, but not reset the account previously imported in Metamask, making the new accounts mistmatch the nonce of the accounts imported previously in MetaMask. 

Click on the "account" icon of MetaMask (top right) and chose "Settings", "Advanced", "Reset account". Reload the web page.
